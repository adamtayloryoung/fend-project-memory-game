## How To Play

Click on the cards to reveal their face. Match the next card, or both cards will flip back over. You must use your memory to solve this puzzle until all 8 card suits are matched. The fewer moves it takes you to complete, the higher your star score will be.


## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
